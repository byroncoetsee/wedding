If you've received this invite, it means that we consider you a member of our really rad inner circle. 
Our problem is that our circle spreads across the whole world. 
<br><br>
We decided to make our wedding a multi-day event, not only so that we'd have enough time to connect with everyone, 
but also for you to get to know some other rad humans that we've specially curated. 
<br><br>
We'll be handling the catering and activities from Tuesday evening to Thursday morning, so we'd love for you to 
stay in the area so we can all do cool things together like braaing, hiking, mountain biking, and even 
meeting the resident sheep (many sheep, not just one sheep).
